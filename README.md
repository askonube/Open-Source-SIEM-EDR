# Open-Source Linux Malware Defence

## Summary

Commercial antivirus solutions provide a solid line of defence for small office and home office (SOHO) networks. However, two main challenges are the subscription-based costs and the limited coverage for Linux systems. While Linux is generally more secure than other platforms, it is not immune to malware and targeted attacks. This iteration of a Linux-based antimalware solution will use only open-source tools, making it an affordable, transparent, and community-supported option for Linux users who want to protect their networks and personal or private data. This solution combines multiple layers of defence—including malware scanning, network intrusion detection, log analysis and management, firewall protection, and threat alerting—making it adaptable for individual users and small businesses.
